# Tic Tac Toe Game Using Python
Hi! I built this Tic Tac Toe game using Python and Tkinter as a fun beginner-friendly GUI project. It's a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid, where players take turns placing their symbol—either "X" or "O"—in an empty cell. The first to align three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. If all the cells are filled with no winner, it’s a draw.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (comes pre-installed with Python)

# How to Play
- The game is played by two players on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns marking a cell with "X" or "O".
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
- If all cells are filled and no one wins, the game ends in a tie.
